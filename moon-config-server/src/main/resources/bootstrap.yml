### To configure an asymmetric key you can either set the key as a PEM-encoded text value (in encrypt.key), or via a keystore (e.g. as created by the keytool utility that comes with the JDK). The keystore properties are encrypt.keyStore.*.
encrypt:
  key: b2baa944-0f36-4b90-bfba-880ffae59eb4
#  keyStore:
#    location: classpath:/server.jks
#    password: letmein
#    alias: mytestkey
#    secret: changeme
